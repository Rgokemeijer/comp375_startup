5. Did you need to spend a project buck on this project to get a one week
   deadline extension? (y/n)

6. Any feedback you with to give me relating the project (e.g. Was it
   interesting? How could it be improved?)

The amount of time on this project spent on the protocol was very minimal to the rest of the projects
debugging. Dealing with the audio recv and send, recv errors was the bulk of the time.
